Virtools Obj Plugin.

An interface plugin of Virtools which allows you to export some models as `.obj` file.

Support Virtools 3.5 and 5.0

## Features

### Advantages

* Can omit world matrix (better than vt2obj. Omiting world matrix will omit object's move, rotation and scale).
* Support Blender and 3ds Max's repostion script for placing object (Place each object with the correct status in 3d software when you omit world matrix)
* Better right-hand left-hand coordinate system conversion. (From fliping Z axis to swaping YZ axis. This is more suit for Blender and 3ds Max 3d system)
* More material export options
* Comparing with vt2obj, it support Virtools 3.5. It is convenient for Ballance object operation.
* Support *one file per object*. It is convenient for exporting object component.

### Shortcomings

* Right-hand left-hand coordinate system conversion only support swaping YZ axis.
* For avoiding same name, all export objects will be attach a unique prefix.
* Use group to split each object and don't provide any option for changing this.
* No smooth group
* Only export 3d object. Don't support 2 dimension structure such as Line and etc.
* Couldn't detect original texture format and save it automatically

## Build

This project have 2 configuration which corresponding with Virtools 3.5 and 5.0. It need their corresponding Virtools SDK to build.
